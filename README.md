## User Stories

Required Stories üö¶üéØüçæ

* [x] The user can see a list of the 20 latest top news stories, loaded dynamically from newsapi.
* [x] For each story, the user sees a headline, the source, a link to more, and an image.
* [x] The user can see the total number of stories currently shown.


Optional Stories

Feel free to experiment with stories here. They are roughly sorted in order of estimated difficulty.

* [x] The user can click a link at the bottom of the page to load the next 20 stories. The page should not refresh; the stories should simply be added to the bottom.
* [x] The user can see an updated number of stories currently shown.
* [x] The user can see how long ago the story was published in a human-friendly format; e.g. "15 minutes ago". To accomplish this, we recommend you use momentjs. Please load it into your page using cdnjs or jsdelivr (these are called CDNs).

Rocket Challenge 1: Sources
* [ ] The user can see a checkbox for every unique source of the articles loaded. For example, if the user loads four stories, and two stories are from bbc-news, one from cnn, and one from spiegel-de, the user would see three checkboxes: bbc-news, cnn, spiegel-de.
* [ ] Next to the source name, the user sees a number representing the number of stories from that source. To continue the previous example: bbc-news (2), cnn (1), spiegel-de (1).
* [ ] The user can toggle the checkbox to hide or show stories from that source in the list.

Rocket Challenge 2: Categories
* [ ] The user can see links or a dropdown that represent the various categories for stories. Selecting on one of these links fetches a new batch of stories of the selected category.
* [ ] The user should see new stories related to the category she chose.
* [ ] The user should see a new or modified URL, with a query parameter representing the chosen category. For example, clicking on entertainment would add ?category=entertainment to the URL. The page should not refresh. To do this, look at URLSearchParameters and PushState.
* [ ] The user should be able to load a page with the appropriate query parameter and automatically have the appropriate stories shown.
